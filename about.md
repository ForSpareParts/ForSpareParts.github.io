Software engineer with experience in a variety of technologies, mostly web related. My most extensive experience is with Python, but I've also done professional work in Ruby and PHP, and I'll pick up other languages/technologies at the drop of a hat.

I got opinions.

My non-work/open-source projects are at [my GitHub page](https://github.com/ForSpareParts/).
