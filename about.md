Software engineer with experience in a variety of technologies, mostly web related. My most extensive experience is with Python and Javascript, but I've also done professional work in Ruby and PHP, and I'm always game to pick up something new.

My non-work/open-source projects are at [my GitHub page](https://github.com/davidwallacejackson/).
