I made a thing for Ludum Dare 32!

[Heel Face Turn](http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/itchio/html/53025/FINAL%20WEBGL%20BUILD/index.html)

Shoot enemies to turn them into allies, but be careful -- you can only have one ally at a time, so
converting another enemy turns your old ally against you! If your bullets hit other bullets, this
will **also** cause your ally to revert to an enemy, because of Reasons. 

WASD to move
Mouse to aim
Click to fire

<!-- more -->

Note that the second level can become unwinnable if you have enemies remaining who are blocked from
each other by walls.

I had a blast making this, and I learned a lot doing it -- I think I have a really solid idea for how to
structure Unity projects in the future. I'll do a post about that soon!
